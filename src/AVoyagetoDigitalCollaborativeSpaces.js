class="c1"><span class="c6 c14 c19">&ldquo;The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information.&rdquo; - Tim Burners Lee</span></p><h1 class="c21" id="h.n0y3gpvj6a5n"><span class="c16">Project Conjure - Embody Data</span></h1><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Conjure is the set of conversations, ideas and protocols necessary to create a truly antifragile, anti-rivalrous, and collaborative Web 3.0. This is a project which explores and builds the infrastructure necessary to create a decentralised toolkit for mapping data to high dimensional spaces which can be visualised, manipulated and explored to generate 3D virtual worlds.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This project currently aims at developing an API in which users are able to control many of the fundamental components of the toolkit, such as graphics rendering and data storage, which enables any number of tools to be created, shared, improved and built upon. This has been coined &lsquo;</span><span class="c2 c14">exponential tooling&rsquo;</span><span class="c2">, where the more tools that are created, the richer the set of abilities of the uses, thus more abstract, complicated and niche tools can iteratively be created.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">All apps and websites suffer from the same non-intuitive and unnatural 2D interfaces, regardless of how flashy and colourful the animations may be. Iron Man, The Minority Report and even Star Wars popularised the idea of holographic screens and intelligent robotic sidekicks, yet decades later we still only have pop-up notifications and third rate digital assistants.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Newsfeed algorithms are designed to optimise the attention of its audience by hijacking the biological addictions we have to connection and information, regardless of quality, leaving us short of our desires. This is not sustainable. An overhaul of the way we interact with the virtual world is long overdue, yet it&rsquo;s hard to fathom what a radical improvement would even look like, or where it may come from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">The core problem with centralised authority is not only the absence of a user&#39;s control of their own data, but in addition the lack of control they have over their experience. A truly useful and collaborative virtual space must be highly intuitive, malleable and personalisable. To unlock the full capacity of the web, the third dimension must be accessed seamlessly in our virtual interactions.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Conjure aims to explore this possibility space by giving users the power to generate infinite virtual spaces, linked by literal </span><span class="c2 c14">&lsquo;portals&rsquo;</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;in the same way the web is linked by hyperlinks. These virtual spaces are called &lsquo;</span><span class="c2 c14">realms&rsquo;</span><span class="c2">, and act similarly to sandbox video game environments.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.n55ph9bp6gog"><span class="c8">The Challenges of Web 2.0</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">People yearn for connection. We are social animals. In an ever increasingly connected world, we assume that naturally, the connections we make would improve our lives. We dream of digital spaces that connect us in ways traditional centralised systems never could. Web 2.0 (the &lsquo;social&rsquo; web) was intended to be an interoperable, user-driven participatory revolution. In some regards it is, but this happened at the wrong level.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The internet can be understood to operate at two layers - the application layer with which users interact, and the data layer with which the applications interact. The social web gave us &lsquo;apps&rsquo; which put the data layer out of reach and control of its users, and instead in server farms behind 100s of pages of ToS and EULA. What has resulted from this disconnect has been the exploitation of the interaction between user and application. This can be thought of as </span><span class="c2 c14">&lsquo;abusive&rsquo;</span><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;as it is a game theoretic win-lose dynamic in which the only way for a user to stop losing, is to stop playing (ie, to discontinue use of the service). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The contrast </span><span class="c2">of this could look like using data to improve user experience by tweaking newsfeed algorithms to show what users want, as well as the platform using that same data to improve the overall experience.</span></p><h3 class="c13" id="h.3zre4yxlahtd"><span class="c3">So, </span><span class="c3 c15">we just need to design a social media app that&rsquo;s open sourced, decentralised and user driven? Problem solved!</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Getting something like this off the ground in a secure and tested manner at scale is no easy task. The components for secure and truly decentralised platforms are still very new, largely untested and in continuous rapid development (with API changes occurring frequently).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">The second problem to be identified is the nature of the applications that currently exist. Text based point and click user interfaces are&hellip; painful to say the least. Current virtual spaces have limiting capacity for embodied experience. Interacting with a 2D screen using a mouse and keyboard is both low bandwidth and unnatural when compared to verbal communication, body language and the full domain of interpersonal connection. Audio and video calls improve this somewhat, but are still largely represented in 2D and suffer the disconnect of a full human-human interaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The key difference to point out between the current virtual and nonvirtual is the notion of physicality. 2D screens strip a whole dimension of possibility, and largely monophonic audio streams similarly. This severely limits our ability as creatures evolved interacting entirely in 3D contexts, to use our capacity to embody an experience. Until we have brain-machine neural interfacing technology, the obvious solution is to bring back the lost dimension. Virtual / augmented / mixed reality (XR) is how that will be achieved. Bringing the third dimension to the internet has been often named the spatial web, and there is a book named as such that goes into much depth on this. You can read about it here: </span><span class="c2 c22"><a class="c10" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-the-spatial-web-bb8127f9ac45&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1600429363739000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0aVzM4EaHTWsLOswvuu0lk">https://medium.com/swlh/an-introduction-to-the-spatial-web-bb8127f9ac45</a></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Furthermore, in the real world (or &lsquo;</span><span class="c2 c14">base reality&rsquo;</span><span class="c4 c2">) we are able to manipulate objects with much higher precision and feedback than a mouse and keyboard or pair of joysticks, using specially designed tools called &lsquo;fingers&rsquo;. Some XR implementations are starting to mimic the same level of dexterity we naturally have, but the feedback of tactile sensation is still largely absent. Machine learning approximations of real time full-body pose estimation coupled with haptic feedback wearables would be adequate for most purposes.</span></p><h3 class="c13" id="h.d7s1hfhhfja"><span class="c3">But what does video conferencing, social media and browsing look like in a 3D space?</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Rather than designing a user interface and subjecting all users to adhere to it, users should be given the freedom to interact with the virtual world in whichever way they choose. This looks like building modular toolkits that users can customise to their preference, in any situation, much like organising a computer desktop or mobile home screen. This doesn&rsquo;t just have to be limited to what the web currently does, but also to all the applications that will be specially and spatially built for it. The underlying principle of this idea is a shift from users interacting with applications that interact with data, and instead letting users interact with their data directly using tools. This then also shifts the ownership and authorship of data from the service to the user.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">There are a few necessary characteristics for what a tool should be. Firstly, it needs to be cross-platform. This doesn&rsquo;t just mean cross-platform in terms of running on your phone, computer, playstation or smart fridge, but also available to be interpreted by any of the applications that run on any of these physical media. This is what true interoperability looks like, and requires rigorous standards to be adhered to. An obvious tough problem to solve is the nature of proprietary protocols that are ubiquitous with current systems and applications. This requires not only open source, but open data ecosystems to exist. Luckily, on the side of open systems are anti-rivalrous dynamics, where the more systems that adopt a set of standards and allow data to flow between contexts and applications, the more the standard and system&rsquo;s value increases. If such an ecosystem (distinct from a system) is to obtain a specific critical mass, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean majority, it will be exponentially adopted until universal, since it is the superior choice.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.kud1skr34qp"><span class="c17">AssetSync - </span><span class="c8">A Truly Scalable Decentralised Data Framework</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">One of the problems developers face when designing decentralised applications (dApps) is the lack of stable frameworks ready to use. There are many use case dependent and developing technologies out there, including IPFS, Interledger, Holochain, though these either aren&rsquo;t ready for serious development or operate at too low a level, requiring large amounts of research, paradigm shifts and boilerplate code to be built on top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">AssetSync is designed to abstract lots of this away, giving developers similar database and file system interfaces they are used to with traditional frameworks, employing an alternative to client/server network models that run wholly decentralised, while maintaining the integrity, security and scalability necessary to build a sustainable and regenerative data ecosystem. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Rethinking the client-server architecture is important, however those terms are still valid in this new paradigm. This can be thought of as an instantiation of the data-application abstraction mentioned earlier, where the server acts as the secure handler of data flow, of which many applications can sit on top of to provide user interfaces. Instead of a traditional server-client architecture, user machines connect peer to peer, distributing the load of the server system among all connected peers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Coherent virtual spaces, such as video game worlds become problematic however, as consensus driven mechanisms like blockchains can lead to small differences in the experienced reality between users. Instead, there needs to be an efficient way of distributing the compute load and storage, while maintaining 100% availability and coherency. This is an example of immediately consistent data, as opposed to eventually consistent data. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">This is the core design motive behind AssetSync, enabling both immediately and eventually consistent data to be standardised and interoperable where appropriate across context and purpose. This is done by providing both mutable and immutable semantic ontology of data as well as all the other necessary components to create a peer to peer network.</span></p><h3 class="c13" id="h.8acsiuqsynzs"><span class="c3 c15">If there is no centralised authority, how do I know my data is safe and secure?</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Modern computational cryptography has come a long way. Methods of secure distributed storage of sensitive information are possible using ledgers, arguments of knowledge and various other forms of proof or signature. Combining these types of cryptography with various blockchain technologies can enable immutable semantic tracking of data to verify secure origin, transaction and authorship of data. Streamed payments and interoperable protocols allow for digital economies and virtual marketplaces to exist and be mediated by it&rsquo;s constituents as autopoietic mechanisms, rather than controlled by closed system authorities.</span></p><h2 class="c5" id="h.aqkplm1qu2xz"><span class="c8">Conjure Space</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c6 c14">Conjure is an </span><span class="c6 c14 c20">interface</span><span class="c19 c6 c14">&nbsp;to Web 3.0 - the infrastructure of the virtual frontier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">Data visualisation and control are at its core what Conjure fundamentally aims to accomplish. Coupled with big data, machine learning and high-bandwidth interaction, increasingly powerful, elegant and efficient tools can be built. If done correctly, this can provide the fabric necessary to increase our collective knowledge, sensemaking abilities and capacity for wisdom by orders of magnitude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This enables virtual spaces and interactions to be coherently </span><span class="c2 c14">embodied</span><span class="c7">&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">yet not </span><span class="c2 c14">constrained</span><span class="c4 c2">. This alone along with all with what has been mentioned previously is enough to create the next generation of media, in which history is written, and the present is lived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">This technology has widespread use cases in leading markets, be it by an aerospace manufacturer exploring their rocket engines, or in an education setting with students exploring protein folding up close.</span><span class="c4 c2">&nbsp;Even software engineers who are trying to develop a deeper understanding of machine learning models by visualising them in high dimensional space that can be physically traversed, warped and studied endlessly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4 c2">It is of the highest importance that the virtual world is fair and indiscriminate in accessibility and power. Standards and interoperability of ledgers, currencies and protocols are a necessity for the spatial web to be available to all. Projects like PayID, Hyperledger and Interledger provide the interoperability of assets and data as well as the flow of value that is necessary for an emergent virtual universe to exist and scale.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c4 c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">What has been discussed (along with improvements to XR technology) will begin to allow fully immersive virtual worlds like Tron&rsquo;s Grid and Ready Player One&rsquo;s Oasis to finally be a reality.
